/****************************************  IMPORTANT NOTE  **********************************

    Comments in this file that start with / * ! or / / ! are being used by Doxygen to
    document the software.  Dashes in these comment blocks are used to create bullet lists.
    The lack of blank lines after a block of dash preceeded comments means that the next
    block of dash preceeded comments is a new, indented bullet list.  I've tried to keep the
    Doxygen formatting to a minimum but there are some other items (like <br> and <pre>)
    that need to be left alone.  If you see a comment that starts with / * ! or / / ! and
    there is something that looks a bit weird it is probably due to some arcane Doxygen
    syntax.  Be very careful modifying blocks of Doxygen comments.
